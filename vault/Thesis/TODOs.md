- **Code**
	- Change the API:
		- make GET /lectures return ALL lectures 
		- create GET /lectures-for-student
		- introduce new endpoint to kick students out of a lecture 
		  reasoning: distinguish in audits if student disenrolled or was kicked out 
    - CRUD
	    - check if indexes are set up correctly 
	    - clean up StatsService 
	    - get rid of N+1 queries 
		    - especially StatsService
		    - LecturesService.getLecturesForStudent() has N+1 query 
	    - examine default lock type, if i have any race conditions, @Version usage 
    - CQRS
	    - try to use TEPs in my E2E tests
	    - use @SequenceNumber aggregateVersion in repositories (https://github.com/idugalic/digital-restaurant/blob/master/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-monolith-rest/src/main/kotlin/com/drestaurant/query/handler/RestaurantHandler.kt) ??
	    - contain JSON parsing and logic inside the projected entities? 
	    - maybe set subscribing processors in bean, not application.properties 
	    - unit test event handlers and aggregates 
		- every projection needs to handle events it cares about, DON'T query local 
		- maybe move external validation (using lookup tables) to message interceptors to avoid blocking the aggregate 
		- is it clean that the lookup tables are injected into every command side? -> should they also keep their own projections? but they would have to be subscribing anyways.. so maybe it doesnt matter because its a "smell" either way 
		- make sure event handlers are idempotent 
			- [[2025-12-16 Problems with my Axon projections]]
		- add @Version to projection entities; retry on OptimisticLockException 
	- **Tests**
		- Performance test for recreating historic state 
		- Introduce a more complex / arbitrary historic query? 
		- Enroll student to more courses in "read-lectures"
		- "get grades" load test 
		- another really complex load test (most JOINs i can find)
		- historical reconstruction load test 
		- read lecture details 
		- **Profile performance of applications**
			- read-lectures: CQRS is slower. i supect JSON deserialization is the issue - should profile this! 
- Statistical significance: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-Test
- **Writing**
	- Write method on flexibility [[Method - Flexibility]] 
	- Mermaid diagram in latex: https://github.com/Witiko/markdown/issues/448 
	- Unify naming of load vs performance testing 
	- Mention that, when trying to audit _read_ operations, event sourcing is not sufficient. 
	- Think of title that is NOT the research question 
	- Write part about envers historic state reconstruction 
		- add Envers to tech stack 
	- need to explain my method of "authentication" somewhere 
	- ES-CQRS: show how to reconstruct state / specific time-travel projections 
## Urgent
- **Run tests**
	- time-to-consistency
	- enrolling
## Before Finishing
- Check README
- Clone repo in blank folder, check everything works
    - -> refine "installation" section of README
- Make sure swagger UI works and requests can be sent 
- Demonstrate how to start docker 
- Demonstrate how to start test run with testcontainers 
- Make sure external links all exist (e.g. to Docker, Axon, etc)
- Push to GitHub aswell and add the link to latex file
- Check all internal links in latex (to source code)
