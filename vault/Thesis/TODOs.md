- **Code**
	- Change the API:
		- make GET /lectures return ALL lectures 
		- create GET /lectures-for-student
		- introduce new endpoint to kick students out of a lecture 
		  reasoning: distinguish in audits if student disenrolled or was kicked out 
    - CRUD
	    - check if indexes are set up correctly 
	    - clean up StatsService 
	    - get rid of N+1 queries 
		    - especially StatsService
		    - LecturesService.getLecturesForStudent() has N+1 query 
	    - examine default lock type, if i have any race conditions, @Version usage 
    - CQRS
	    - try to use TEPs in my E2E tests
	    - unit test event handlers and aggregates 
		- every projection needs to handle events it cares about, DON'T use query gateway
		- is it clean that the lookup tables are injected into every command side? -> should they also keep their own projections? but they would have to be subscribing anyways.. so maybe it doesnt matter because its a "smell" either way 
		- make sure event handlers are idempotent 
			- [[2025-12-16 Problems with my Axon projections]]
		- add @Version to projection entities; retry on OptimisticLockException 
	- **Tests**
		- Introduce a more complex / arbitrary historic query? 
		- Enroll student to more courses in "read-lectures" 
		- another really complex load test (most JOINs i can find)
		- historical reconstruction load test 
		- read lecture details 
- Statistical significance: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-Test
- **Writing** 
	- Unify naming of load vs performance testing 
	- [[2026-02-04 Fragen fürs nächste Meeting]]
	- "load testing" vs "stress testing"?
	- Feedback von Jordine einarbeiten 
	- Technologien den Anforderungen zuordnen 
	- Move metrics and load testing basics from Methodology to Basics?
	- Fix ER diagram of CRUD app, simplify explanation 
	- Tabellen: Mean durch Median ersetzen 
## Before Finishing
- Check READMES 
- Clone repo in blank folder, check everything works
    - -> refine "installation" section of README
- Make sure swagger UI works and requests can be sent 
- Make sure external links all exist (e.g. to Docker, Axon, etc)
- Push to GitHub aswell and add the repo link to latex file
- Check all internal links in latex (to source code)
- **Tag final commit on date of submission** 
- Add all used AI tools to appendix 
- Check that research question is correct everywhere 
- Unterschrift im PDF platzieren
- Make sure all versions are pinned in pom.xml 
- Make sure glossary entries and acronyms can all be resolved -> check latex compiler logs 
- Glossary entries hinzufügen
	- all flexibility metrics
