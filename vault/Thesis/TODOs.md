- think about the database that stores projections #database #projection
    - i want to use postgres
    - but maybe its not good to use the same db instance as the instance that logs the event stream?
- find and read papers relevant to the topics
	- tactical design 
    - DDD #DDD
        - [[Domain-Driven Design Quickly, A Summary of Eric Evans' Domain-Driven Design]]
    - ES #es
        - Projections!
        - read "Evaluation and Use of Event Sourcing" (Bachelorarbeit)
    - Audit Logs #audit-log
        - "Evaluation and Use of Event Sourcing (BA)"
    - Performance measurement best practices #performance
    - (maybe) schema evolution in ES #es #schema
    - CQRS #cqrs
    - -> check HdM library for some books
        - DDD full version?
  - anemic domain model?
      - what is it, opposite of DDD, relevance?
- roter Faden / Gliederung entwickeln (und besprechen)
- create GEMINI.md file in the project root #llm
- code
    - CRUD
	    - check if indexes are set up correctly 
	    - clean up StatsService 
	    - get rid of N+1 queries (especially StatsService)
    - CQRS
	    - try to use TEPs in my E2E tests
	    - use @SequenceNumber aggregateVersion in repositories (https://github.com/idugalic/digital-restaurant/blob/master/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-monolith-rest/src/main/kotlin/com/drestaurant/query/handler/RestaurantHandler.kt) ??
	    - improve thrown exceptions by adding more context, e.g. require aggregate ID 
	    - contain JSON parsing and logic inside the projected entities 
	    - maybe set subscribing processors in bean, not application.properties 
	    - unit test event handlers and aggregates 
	    - architecture tests:
		    - validation services annotated 
		- check if i have to configure TEPs to not be in-memory 
		- every projection needs to handle events it cares about, DON'T query local projections 
			- rename projections tables -> prefix with their context 
		- maybe move external validation (using lookup tables) to message interceptors to avoid blocking the aggregate 
- look at axon transaction manager? 
	- what is it  
	- for what can it be used?
	- compare to [[Axon Unit Of Work]]

## Before Finishing
- Check README
- Clone repo in blank folder, check everything works
    - -> refine "installation" section of README
