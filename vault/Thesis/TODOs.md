- think about the database that stores projections #database #projection
    - i want to use postgres
    - but maybe its not good to use the same db instance as the instance that logs the event stream?
- find and read papers relevant to the topics

        - DDD full version?
- **Code**
    - CRUD
	    - check if indexes are set up correctly 
	    - clean up StatsService 
	    - get rid of N+1 queries (especially StatsService)
    - CQRS
	    - try to use TEPs in my E2E tests
	    - use @SequenceNumber aggregateVersion in repositories (https://github.com/idugalic/digital-restaurant/blob/master/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-monolith-rest/src/main/kotlin/com/drestaurant/query/handler/RestaurantHandler.kt) ??
	    - contain JSON parsing and logic inside the projected entities? 
	    - maybe set subscribing processors in bean, not application.properties 
	    - unit test event handlers and aggregates 
		- every projection needs to handle events it cares about, DON'T query local 
		- maybe move external validation (using lookup tables) to message interceptors to avoid blocking the aggregate 
		- is it clean that the lookup tables are injected into every command side? -> should they also keep their own projections? but they would have to be subscribing anyways.. so maybe it doesnt matter because its a "smell" either way 
		- make sure event handlers are idempotent 
- look at axon transaction manager? 
	- what is it  
	- for what can it be used / how is it used 
	- compare to [[Axon Unit Of Work]]

## Before Finishing
- Check README
- Clone repo in blank folder, check everything works
    - -> refine "installation" section of README
- Make sure swagger UI works and requests can be sent 
- Demonstrate how to start docker 
- Demonstrate how to start test run with testcontainers 
- Make sure external links all exist (e.g. to Docker, Axon, etc)
