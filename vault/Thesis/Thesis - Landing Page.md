**Title**
> **Performance, flexibility and traceability:** Evaluating the Impact of Event Sourcing and CQRS compared to traditional systems with an audit log.

**Primary research question**
> How does an Event-sourced CQRS architecture compare to CRUD systems with an independent audit log regarding performance, scalability, flexibility and traceability?

Three sub-questions: 
- **Performance and Scalability:** How do CRUD and ES-CQRS implementations perform under increasing load, and what are the resulting implications for system scalability and resource efficiency? 
- **Architectural Complexity and Flexibility:** What are the fundamental structural differences between the two approaches, and how do these impact the long-term flexibility and evolution of the codebase? 
- **Historical Traceability:** To what extent can CRUD and ES-CQRS systems accurately and efficiently reconstruct historical states to satisfy business intent and compliance requirements?
