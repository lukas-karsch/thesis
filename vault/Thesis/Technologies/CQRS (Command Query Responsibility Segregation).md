CQRS, or ==Command Query Responsibility Segregation==, is an architectural pattern that separates a system's responsibilities for handling **commands** (which are actions that change state) and **queries** (which retrieve data). By splitting these two distinct operations, each can be optimized independently for performance, security, and scalability. For example, commands can be handled by one data model and queries by another, potentially using different technologies optimized for each task.
