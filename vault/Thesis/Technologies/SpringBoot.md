Spring Boot is the foundation for both the **CRUD** and **Event Sourcing (ES)** systems. It is an opinionated framework that simplifies the creation of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It handles much of the boilerplate configuration, allowing me to focus on the business logic of the course enrollment and grading system.
