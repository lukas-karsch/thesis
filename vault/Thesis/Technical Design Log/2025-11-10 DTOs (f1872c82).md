To ensure clean communication, **all** endpoints will use DTOs. This forces me to use a mapper and never accidentally return sensitive fields from the backend. 
## Error or Success responses 
Commands do not return data - this is a [[CQRS]] principle, but I will enforce it in both implementations so that they have an identical interface. 

To still return _something_, I must think about the way I return errors and success. 

I'm thinking of creating a generic ApiResponse< T> class that will be returned from every endpoint. It could look like this: 

```typescript
{
	"result": "success" | "error",
	"data": T
}
```

Always combine this with appropriate status codes and I should be good. 
### Error Responses
- Define custom RuntimeException subclasses 
- Derive the status code from those 
- `@ControllerAdvice` global exception handler with `@ExceptionHandler` methods 
- **`ProblemDetail`** class from Spring https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-return-errors-problemdetail

## Today 
Now, I will start to implement the DTOs.
