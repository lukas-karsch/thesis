## Feedback on the exposé

- looks good
- Mentioned potential risk of too much effort because the Axon framework is unknown to me
- Suggestion to look at developer experience and implementation complexity as a metric
    - have to look into sources, and how to apply those to my use case
    - qualitative metrics = hard to measure
    - e.g. "how long does it take to implement the same use case in both applications?"
- YES, always document what I'm doing! especially when i want to rate developer experience or flexibility (afterwards)
- It wasn't clear how I plan to implement the project structure / how I'll test it - explained it and it was fine

## Hypothesis?

- maybe!
- depends on the literature
    - if literature has opinions on architecture, try to suggest one
    - otherwise, don't put a random hypothesis!

> This does mean that [[Expose Lukas Karsch Bachelorarbeit_02.pdf]] is the final version.
