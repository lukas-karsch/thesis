## Notes 
### Martin Metrics
I removed the "karsch.lukas" package from metrics 
### Literature 
- main pain point of event sourcing: schema evolution
	- Overeem et. al 2021
- Evolutionary Architectures

- Chawla and Kauer, Comparative Study of the Software Metrics for the complexity and maintainability of software development 
- Deshpande et al. "Object oriented design metrics for software defect prediction"
- Singh, Object oriented coupling based test case prioritization 
- **Object Oriented Coupling based Test Case Prioritization**
   Defines and analyzes the **CK Metrics Suite** (WMC, DIT, NOC, CBO, RFC, LCOM)
