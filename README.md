# Event Sourcing vs. CRUD 

> How does an Event Sourcing architecture compare to CRUD systems with an independent audit log, when it comes to scalability, performance and traceability? 

## About the project 

This thesis compares two implementations of an API with the same interface - one implementation is built using a typical layered CRUD architecture, the other one is built using DDD principles and Event Sourcing. 

Both implementations use the same underlying technology:

- SpringBoot 
- PostgreSQL
