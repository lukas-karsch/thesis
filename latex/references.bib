	abstract = {In the domain of software architecture, Event Sourcing (ES) has emerged as a significant paradigm, especially for systems requiring high levels of auditability, traceability, and intricate state management. Systems such as financial transaction platforms, inventory management systems, customer relationship management (CRM) software, and any application requiring a detailed audit trail can significantly benefit from this approach. Numerous aspects of ES remain unexplored, as they have yet to be thoroughly investigated by scientific research. The unique demands of such systems, particularly in terms of database performance and functionality, are not adequately addressed by existing database benchmarks. By establishing benchmarks, organizations can compare different databases to determine which best meets their needs for applications. This aids in selecting the most appropriate technology based on empirical data rather than assumptions or marketing claims.This paper introduces a novel benchmarking framework specifically designed for evaluating databases in the context of event sourcing. The framework addresses critical aspects unique to ES, including event append performance, efficient handling of Projections (separate databases for read operations), strong consistency, ordered data insertion, and robust versioning controls. Through rigorous testing and analysis, this framework aims to fill the gap in existing database benchmarking tools, providing a more accurate and relevant assessment for ES systems. We also conducted experiments that not only demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach but also yielded meaningful results, substantiating its practicality and applicability.},

On the one hand, the property allowing a system to be catered by automated monitoring and healing technology is defined as observability . On the other hand, appropriate design principles to manifest observability were originally referred as event sourcing by its inventor Martin Fowler and warrant for the aforementioned sustainable software operations. Both event sourcing and observability are complex to leverage on and design for. In an effort to understand more on both concepts, we offer an experience report on their practical use, featuring: (1) a rigorous definition of software architecture observability and a set of principles to design for observability using augmented forms of well-known design patterns in line with event sourcing; and (2) an impact analysis in the context of a case study. Our study reveals several interesting notions around the concept of observability but our findings also make explicit new architecture trade-offs that software architects and stakeholders need to consider as first-class architecture-level concerns.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jss.2021.111015},
	abstract = {Event Sourcing (ES) systems use an event log with the double purpose of keeping application state and providing decoupled communication. While ES systems keep track of all business events, other untracked events, either from internal components or from external systems may still cause failures. Determining the root cause of such failures usually involves complex procedures based on replaying the event log. Unlike this, in distributed systems, developers often instrument the source code, for the sake of improving observability and perform tracing on workflows and data.
Adding tracing to ES thus seems like an unexplored and powerful approach to improve the observability of the system. In this paper, we suggest possible implementations of the idea and discuss their merits. These include the adoption of well-known tracing-related tools and standards in ES systems, with the respective advantages for root-cause analysis, anomaly detection, profiling and others.},

In these systems, there are multiple services each with its own code and data, and ability to operate independently of its partners. In particular, atomic transactions with two-phase commit do not occur across multiple services because this necessitates holding locks while another service decides the outcome of the transaction. This paper proposes there are a number of seminal differences between data inside a service and data sent into the space outside of the service boundary. We then consider objects, SQL, and XML as different representations of data. Each of these models has strengths and weaknesses when applied to the inside and outside of the service boundary. The paper concludes that the strength of each of these models in one area is derived from essential characteristics underlying its weakness in the other area.},
