	abstract = {In the domain of software architecture, Event Sourcing (ES) has emerged as a significant paradigm, especially for systems requiring high levels of auditability, traceability, and intricate state management. Systems such as financial transaction platforms, inventory management systems, customer relationship management (CRM) software, and any application requiring a detailed audit trail can significantly benefit from this approach. Numerous aspects of ES remain unexplored, as they have yet to be thoroughly investigated by scientific research. The unique demands of such systems, particularly in terms of database performance and functionality, are not adequately addressed by existing database benchmarks. By establishing benchmarks, organizations can compare different databases to determine which best meets their needs for applications. This aids in selecting the most appropriate technology based on empirical data rather than assumptions or marketing claims.This paper introduces a novel benchmarking framework specifically designed for evaluating databases in the context of event sourcing. The framework addresses critical aspects unique to ES, including event append performance, efficient handling of Projections (separate databases for read operations), strong consistency, ordered data insertion, and robust versioning controls. Through rigorous testing and analysis, this framework aims to fill the gap in existing database benchmarking tools, providing a more accurate and relevant assessment for ES systems. We also conducted experiments that not only demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach but also yielded meaningful results, substantiating its practicality and applicability.},

On the one hand, the property allowing a system to be catered by automated monitoring and healing technology is defined as observability . On the other hand, appropriate design principles to manifest observability were originally referred as event sourcing by its inventor Martin Fowler and warrant for the aforementioned sustainable software operations. Both event sourcing and observability are complex to leverage on and design for. In an effort to understand more on both concepts, we offer an experience report on their practical use, featuring: (1) a rigorous definition of software architecture observability and a set of principles to design for observability using augmented forms of well-known design patterns in line with event sourcing; and (2) an impact analysis in the context of a case study. Our study reveals several interesting notions around the concept of observability but our findings also make explicit new architecture trade-offs that software architects and stakeholders need to consider as first-class architecture-level concerns.},

	abstract = {Event Sourcing (ES) systems use an event log with the double purpose of keeping application state and providing decoupled communication. While ES systems keep track of all business events, other untracked events, either from internal components or from external systems may still cause failures. Determining the root cause of such failures usually involves complex procedures based on replaying the event log. Unlike this, in distributed systems, developers often instrument the source code, for the sake of improving observability and perform tracing on workflows and data.
Adding tracing to ES thus seems like an unexplored and powerful approach to improve the observability of the system. In this paper, we suggest possible implementations of the idea and discuss their merits. These include the adoption of well-known tracing-related tools and standards in ES systems, with the respective advantages for root-cause analysis, anomaly detection, profiling and others.},

            Evolution of software development process and increasing complexity of software systems calls for developers to pay great attention to the evolution of CASE tools for software development. This, in turn, causes explosion for appearance of a new wave (or new generation) of such CASE tools. The authors of the paper have been working on the development of the so-called two-hemisphere model-driven approach and its supporting BrainTool for the past 10 years. This paper is a step forward in the research on the ability to use the two-hemisphere model driven approach for system modelling at the problem domain level and to generate UML diagrams and software code from the two-hemisphere model. The paper discusses the usage of anemic domain model instead of rich domain model and offers the main principle of transformation of the two-hemisphere model into the first one.},

	abstract = {Design pattern is a set of solutions that is used to solve software development common problems. The purpose of design pattern utilization is to improve software quality. Various design patterns have been proposed. One of them is Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (PoEAA) which are specified for enterprise application. However, there are lacks of literature that discuss these patterns. This research conducts a quantitative study to assess the impact of design pattern on software maintainability. We use Academic Information System of Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember as a case study. It is an enterprise software which has Anemic Domain Model. We perform refactoring into the existing systems using suitable PoEAA. We measure its maintainability using C\&K and three additional metrics, prior and after the refactoring process. The measurement results are then evaluated to obtain the impact. Based on the experiments, we clearly observe that PoEAA utilization could significantly restructure the anemic domain model of AIS. The maintainability is increased especially in presentation layer. PoEAA also eliminates duplicated methods in service and repository layer of the existing version of AIS. However, there are several drawbacks of the improvements.},

	doi = {10.1145/3475716.3475771},
	abstract = {Background: Distributed data-intensive systems are increasingly designed to be only eventually consistent. Persistent data is no longer processed with serialized and transactional access, exposing applications to a range of potential concurrency anomalies that need to be handled by the application itself. Controlling concurrent data access in monolithic systems is already challenging, but the problem is exacerbated in distributed systems. To make it worse, only little systematic engineering guidance is provided by the software architecture community regarding this issue. Aims: In this paper, we report on our study of the effectiveness and applicability of the novel design guidelines we are proposing in this regard. Method: We used action research and conducted it in the context of the software architecture design process of a multi-site platform development project. Results: Our hypotheses regarding effectiveness and applicability have been accepted in the context of the study. The initial design guidelines were refined throughout the study. Thus, we also contribute concrete guidelines for architecting distributed data-intensive systems with eventually consistent data. The guidelines are an advancement of Domain-Driven Design and provide additional patterns for the tactical design part. Conclusions: Based on our results, we recommend using the guidelines to architect safe eventually consistent systems. Because of the relevance of distributed data-intensive systems, we will drive this research forward and evaluate it in further domains.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1405.1618},
	abstract = {Most Java applications, including web based ones, follow the 3-tier architecture. Although Java provides standard tools for tier-to-tier interfaces, the separation of the tiers is usually not perfect. E.g. the database interface, JDBC, assumes that SQL statements are issued from the application server. Similarly, in web based Java applications, HTML code is assumed to be produced by servlets. In terms of syntax, this turns Java source code into mixtures of languages: Java and SQL, Java and HTML. These language mixtures are difficult to read, modify, and maintain. In this paper we examine criteria and methods to achieve a good separation of the 3 tiers and propose a technique to provide a clean separation. Our proposed technique requires an explicit Interface and Data Definitions. These allow isolation of the back-end, application server, and front-end development. The Definitions also enable application design in terms of aggregated data structures. As a result significant amounts of auxiliary code can be generated from the Definitions, enabling the developers to concentrate on the business logic. By and large the proposed approach greatly facilitates development and maintenance, and overall improves the quality of the products.},

The development for compliance-by-design as compliance as compliance represents a fundamental paradigm change in financial system architecture. This technical article explores comprehensive frameworks for implementing regulatory-centric system design across financial operations platforms. The discussion encompasses foundational principles of audit traceability through event sourcing patterns and immutable audit trails that capture complete transaction contexts with precise temporal information. Version control strategies extend beyond traditional source code management to include sophisticated bi-temporal data models tracking valid time and transaction time dimensions. Metadata lineage tracking leverages graph-based architectures, enabling forward and backward traceability across distributed financial data environments. Transaction trail design integrates event-driven architectures with streaming platforms to support real-time compliance validation while maintaining guaranteed delivery and ordering properties essential for regulatory accuracy. Exception handling workflows employ adaptive techniques, including reinforcement learning for dynamic policy optimization and automated remediation capabilities. The compliance-by-design implementation framework introduces architectural patterns such as Command Query Responsibility Segregation and attribute-based access control systems that embed regulatory requirements into fundamental system structures. Continuous compliance monitoring provides real-time assessment capabilities with rule-based detection engines and automated alert generation supporting regulatory submissions across jurisdictional frameworks.},
