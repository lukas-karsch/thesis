	abstract = {In the domain of software architecture, Event Sourcing (ES) has emerged as a significant paradigm, especially for systems requiring high levels of auditability, traceability, and intricate state management. Systems such as financial transaction platforms, inventory management systems, customer relationship management (CRM) software, and any application requiring a detailed audit trail can significantly benefit from this approach. Numerous aspects of ES remain unexplored, as they have yet to be thoroughly investigated by scientific research. The unique demands of such systems, particularly in terms of database performance and functionality, are not adequately addressed by existing database benchmarks. By establishing benchmarks, organizations can compare different databases to determine which best meets their needs for applications. This aids in selecting the most appropriate technology based on empirical data rather than assumptions or marketing claims.This paper introduces a novel benchmarking framework specifically designed for evaluating databases in the context of event sourcing. The framework addresses critical aspects unique to ES, including event append performance, efficient handling of Projections (separate databases for read operations), strong consistency, ordered data insertion, and robust versioning controls. Through rigorous testing and analysis, this framework aims to fill the gap in existing database benchmarking tools, providing a more accurate and relevant assessment for ES systems. We also conducted experiments that not only demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach but also yielded meaningful results, substantiating its practicality and applicability.},

On the one hand, the property allowing a system to be catered by automated monitoring and healing technology is defined as observability . On the other hand, appropriate design principles to manifest observability were originally referred as event sourcing by its inventor Martin Fowler and warrant for the aforementioned sustainable software operations. Both event sourcing and observability are complex to leverage on and design for. In an effort to understand more on both concepts, we offer an experience report on their practical use, featuring: (1) a rigorous definition of software architecture observability and a set of principles to design for observability using augmented forms of well-known design patterns in line with event sourcing; and (2) an impact analysis in the context of a case study. Our study reveals several interesting notions around the concept of observability but our findings also make explicit new architecture trade-offs that software architects and stakeholders need to consider as first-class architecture-level concerns.},

	abstract = {Event Sourcing (ES) systems use an event log with the double purpose of keeping application state and providing decoupled communication. While ES systems keep track of all business events, other untracked events, either from internal components or from external systems may still cause failures. Determining the root cause of such failures usually involves complex procedures based on replaying the event log. Unlike this, in distributed systems, developers often instrument the source code, for the sake of improving observability and perform tracing on workflows and data.
Adding tracing to ES thus seems like an unexplored and powerful approach to improve the observability of the system. In this paper, we suggest possible implementations of the idea and discuss their merits. These include the adoption of well-known tracing-related tools and standards in ES systems, with the respective advantages for root-cause analysis, anomaly detection, profiling and others.},

            Evolution of software development process and increasing complexity of software systems calls for developers to pay great attention to the evolution of CASE tools for software development. This, in turn, causes explosion for appearance of a new wave (or new generation) of such CASE tools. The authors of the paper have been working on the development of the so-called two-hemisphere model-driven approach and its supporting BrainTool for the past 10 years. This paper is a step forward in the research on the ability to use the two-hemisphere model driven approach for system modelling at the problem domain level and to generate UML diagrams and software code from the two-hemisphere model. The paper discusses the usage of anemic domain model instead of rich domain model and offers the main principle of transformation of the two-hemisphere model into the first one.},

	abstract = {Design pattern is a set of solutions that is used to solve software development common problems. The purpose of design pattern utilization is to improve software quality. Various design patterns have been proposed. One of them is Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (PoEAA) which are specified for enterprise application. However, there are lacks of literature that discuss these patterns. This research conducts a quantitative study to assess the impact of design pattern on software maintainability. We use Academic Information System of Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember as a case study. It is an enterprise software which has Anemic Domain Model. We perform refactoring into the existing systems using suitable PoEAA. We measure its maintainability using C\&K and three additional metrics, prior and after the refactoring process. The measurement results are then evaluated to obtain the impact. Based on the experiments, we clearly observe that PoEAA utilization could significantly restructure the anemic domain model of AIS. The maintainability is increased especially in presentation layer. PoEAA also eliminates duplicated methods in service and repository layer of the existing version of AIS. However, there are several drawbacks of the improvements.},

	doi = {10.1145/3475716.3475771},
	abstract = {Background: Distributed data-intensive systems are increasingly designed to be only eventually consistent. Persistent data is no longer processed with serialized and transactional access, exposing applications to a range of potential concurrency anomalies that need to be handled by the application itself. Controlling concurrent data access in monolithic systems is already challenging, but the problem is exacerbated in distributed systems. To make it worse, only little systematic engineering guidance is provided by the software architecture community regarding this issue. Aims: In this paper, we report on our study of the effectiveness and applicability of the novel design guidelines we are proposing in this regard. Method: We used action research and conducted it in the context of the software architecture design process of a multi-site platform development project. Results: Our hypotheses regarding effectiveness and applicability have been accepted in the context of the study. The initial design guidelines were refined throughout the study. Thus, we also contribute concrete guidelines for architecting distributed data-intensive systems with eventually consistent data. The guidelines are an advancement of Domain-Driven Design and provide additional patterns for the tactical design part. Conclusions: Based on our results, we recommend using the guidelines to architect safe eventually consistent systems. Because of the relevance of distributed data-intensive systems, we will drive this research forward and evaluate it in further domains.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1405.1618},
	abstract = {Most Java applications, including web based ones, follow the 3-tier architecture. Although Java provides standard tools for tier-to-tier interfaces, the separation of the tiers is usually not perfect. E.g. the database interface, JDBC, assumes that SQL statements are issued from the application server. Similarly, in web based Java applications, HTML code is assumed to be produced by servlets. In terms of syntax, this turns Java source code into mixtures of languages: Java and SQL, Java and HTML. These language mixtures are difficult to read, modify, and maintain. In this paper we examine criteria and methods to achieve a good separation of the 3 tiers and propose a technique to provide a clean separation. Our proposed technique requires an explicit Interface and Data Definitions. These allow isolation of the back-end, application server, and front-end development. The Definitions also enable application design in terms of aggregated data structures. As a result significant amounts of auxiliary code can be generated from the Definitions, enabling the developers to concentrate on the business logic. By and large the proposed approach greatly facilitates development and maintenance, and overall improves the quality of the products.},

The development for compliance-by-design as compliance as compliance represents a fundamental paradigm change in financial system architecture. This technical article explores comprehensive frameworks for implementing regulatory-centric system design across financial operations platforms. The discussion encompasses foundational principles of audit traceability through event sourcing patterns and immutable audit trails that capture complete transaction contexts with precise temporal information. Version control strategies extend beyond traditional source code management to include sophisticated bi-temporal data models tracking valid time and transaction time dimensions. Metadata lineage tracking leverages graph-based architectures, enabling forward and backward traceability across distributed financial data environments. Transaction trail design integrates event-driven architectures with streaming platforms to support real-time compliance validation while maintaining guaranteed delivery and ordering properties essential for regulatory accuracy. Exception handling workflows employ adaptive techniques, including reinforcement learning for dynamic policy optimization and automated remediation capabilities. The compliance-by-design implementation framework introduces architectural patterns such as Command Query Responsibility Segregation and attribute-based access control systems that embed regulatory requirements into fundamental system structures. Continuous compliance monitoring provides real-time assessment capabilities with rule-based detection engines and automated alert generation supporting regulatory submissions across jurisdictional frameworks.},

The book became a part of Intel"s 2012 recommended reading list for developers, and it covers the revolution of mobile computing. The text also highlights the two most important factors in architecture today: parallelism and memory hierarchy. The six chapters that this book is composed of follow a consistent framework: explanation of the ideas in each chapter; a ""crosscutting issues"" section, which presents how the concepts covered in one chapter connect with those given in other chapters; a ""putting it all together"" section that links these concepts by discussing how they are applied in real machine; and detailed examples of misunderstandings and architectural traps commonly encountered by developers and architects. The first chapter of the book includes formulas for energy, static and dynamic power, integrated circuit costs, reliability, and availability. Chapter 2 discusses memory hierarchy and includes discussions about virtual machines, SRAM and DRAM technologies, and new material on Flash memory. The third chapter covers the exploitation of instruction-level parallelism in high-performance processors, superscalar execution, dynamic scheduling and multithreading, followed by an introduction to vector architectures in the fourth chapter. Chapters 5 and 6 describe multicore processors and warehouse-scale computers (WSCs), respectively},

	abstract = {The development of web technologies and standards such as HTTP, XML, SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI enables pervasive adoption and deployment of web services. In a highly competitive business environment, quality of service is one of the substantial aspects for differentiating between similar service providers. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) between a service provider and its customers will assure customers that they can get the service they pay for and will obligate the service provider to achieve its service promises. Failing to meet SLAs could result in serious financial consequences for a provider. Hence, service providers are interested in gaining a good understanding of the relationship between what they can promise in an SLA and what their IT infrastructure is capable of delivering. Similarly, consumers are interested in understanding the impact of the SLAs they sign on their own productivity. In this paper, we present a novel approach to model and understand these relationships. Our model captures composition relationships between providers and consumers, as well the SLA between them. Our approach is based on simulation of the model and sensitivity analysis.},

This paper presents a scalability metric based on coste ectiveness, where the e ectiveness is a function of the system's throughput and its quality of service. It is part of a framework which also includes a scaling strategy for introducing changes as a function of a scale factor, and an automated virtual design optimization at each scale factor. This is an adaptation of concepts for scalability measures in parallel computing. Scalability is measured by the range of scale factors that give a satisfactory value of the metric, and good scalability is a joint property of the initial design and the scaling strategy. The results give insight into the scaling capacity of the designs, and into how to improve the design. A rapid simple bound on the metric is also described.},

	abstract = {Financial technology platforms based on event-driven microservices architectures have the potential to meet scalability, fault tolerance, and regulatory compliance demands, which are not achievable in monolithic systems. This architectural model does not make use of request-response communications but provides event-based messaging that is asynchronous and allows the decoupling of time, such that services work at their own speeds and can scale at will in case of failures. A markup log system like Apache Kafka offers a distributed commit log with strictly ordered guarantees needed by financial transactions to sequence them, and architecture designs like event sourcing and Command Query Responsibility Separation limit immutable audit logs and provide query optimization. The deployment configurations exploit distributed clusters having replication mechanisms that allow zero loss of data in the event of broker failures, which have been shown via controlled chaos engineering experiments to reassign partitions automatically, as well as ensuring event delivery. Since comparative performance evaluation shows significant gains with respect to the use of synchronous architectures, and the burden of consensus trade-offs is addressed by idempotent consumers and compensating transactions. Practical applications in investment platforms and payment gateways reveal the ability to handle Zaibatsu-frequency trades, to execute payment approval processes, and to enjoy regulatory compliance using append-only event stores. With the architectural flexibility, the financial institutions are already in a position to rapidly adapt to competitive factors and evolving regulations without needing a platform migration.},

	abstract = {Context:
With the acknowledged benefits of microservices architectures, such as scalability, flexibility, improved maintenance, and deployment, legacy software systems are increasingly being reengineered into microservices. Recently, a plethora of methods, techniques, tools, and evaluation criteria for reengineering software systems into microservices have been proposed without being systematized.
Objectives:
The objective of this work is to conduct an in-depth systematic literature review to identify and analyze methods, techniques, and tools for reengineering software systems into microservices and the ways for evaluating such reengineering initiatives and their results.
Methods:
A systematic literature review of works on reengineering software systems into microservices was performed, yielding 117 primary studies. The review focused on addressing key research questions concerning the evolution of microservices reengineering, methodologies employed, tools available, and the challenges faced in the reengineering process. We used a taxonomy development method to systematize knowledge in these areas.
Results:
The analysis revealed multiple reengineering approaches: static, dynamic, hybrid, and artifact-driven. Significant evaluation criteria identified include coupling, cohesion, and modularity. Key paradigms for microservices reengineering, such as domain-driven design and interface analysis, were identified and discussed. The study also highlights that incremental and iterative transitions are favored in practice.
Conclusion:
This study provides a structured overview of the current state of research on reengineering software systems into microservices. It highlights challenges in existing reengineering methodologies. Future directions include validating behavioral equivalence of original and reengineered systems, automating microservices generation, and refining database layer partitioning. The findings emphasize the need for further work to enhance the reengineering process and evaluation of the transition between monolithic and microservices architectures.},

	abstract = {Maintaining consistency and scalability together with auditability across complex microservices architectures in contemporary distributed systems presents new challenges. Traditional centralized database systems face challenges because of their strong coupling, as well as insufficient tracing capabilities and problems with maintaining data integrity across distributed service boundaries. Asynchronous communication patterns help event-driven systems overcome some decoupling issues, but they frequently lack centralized authoritative record-keeping mechanisms for state transitions. Although ledger-based systems offer extensive traceability through cryptographic verification and mathematical immutability guarantees, they usually function independently of larger event-driven infrastructure. This creates architectural gaps where organizations maintain parallel systems for operational events and audit compliance, leading to data duplication and synchronization overhead. By combining immutable state recording with real-time system behavior coordination, the suggested ledger-centric, event-driven architecture positions the ledger as the active engine for state evolution and the ultimate source of truth. The four interrelated levels of the framework—Event Ingestion, Ledger, Processing and Projection, and Audit and Compliance—are individually made to manage workloads at the enterprise level while maintaining the promises of mathematical immutability. Event immutability and self-contained data structures are prioritized by implementation guidelines to guarantee processing dependability and state consistency across dispersed transaction boundaries, with the ultimate system source of truth being the ledger, while idempotency patterns are applied exhaustively.},

	abstract = {Given the central role that software development plays in the delivery and application of information technology, managers are increasingly focusing on process improvement in the software development area. This demand has spurred the provision of a number of new and/or improved approaches to software development, with perhaps the most prominent being object-orientation (OO). In addition, the focus on process improvement has increased the demand for software measures, or metrics with which to manage the process. The need for such metrics is particularly acute when an organization is adopting a new technology for which established practices have yet to be developed. This research addresses these needs through the development and implementation of a new suite of metrics for OO design. Metrics developed in previous research, while contributing to the field’s understanding of software development processes, have generally been subject to serious criticisms, including the lack of a theoretical base. Following Wand and Weber, the theoretical base chosen for the metrics was the ontology of Bunge. Six design metrics are developed, and then analytically evaluated against Weyuker’s proposed set of measurement principles. An automated data collection tool was then developed and implemented to collect an empirical sample of these metrics at two field sites in order to demonstrate their feasibility and suggest ways in which managers may use these metrics for process improvement.},

	abstract = {Although the benefits of Object-Orientation are manifold and it is, for certain, one of the mainstays for software production in the future, it will only achieve widespread practical acceptance when the management aspects of the software development process using this technology are carefully addressed. Here, software metrics play an important role allowing, among other things, better planning, the assessment of improvements, the reduction of unpredictability, early identification of potential problems and productivity evaluation. This paper proposes a set of metrics suitable for evaluating the use of the main abstractions of the Object-Oriented paradigm such as inheritance, encapsulation, information hiding or polymorphism and the consequent emphasis on reuse that, together, are believed to be responsible for the increase in software quality and development productivity. Those metrics are aimed at helping to establish comparisons throughout the practitioners’ community and setting design recommendations that may eventually become organization standards. Some desirable properties for such a metrics set are also presented. Future lines of research are envisaged.},

	abstract = {The article addresses the issue of migrating applications, particularly those following the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture, to the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) paradigm with Event Sourcing. Long-standing systems often need help with problems related to inflexible, outdated architecture, and dependencies, leading to increased maintenance costs. The paper examines the advantages of DDD and proposes CQRS as a viable alternative, focusing on improving productivity and scalability.The main objective of the work is to assess a secure path for migrating a project from DDD architecture to the CQRS and Event Sourcing architecture and to determine the migration roadmap. The article conducts an experiment in which migration of a test project is performed, evaluating the time, effort, and results of the migration. The research methodology includes evaluating complexity using McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity metric and assessing performance through the execution time of system methods.The experiment is conducted on a typical project – a task-tracking system. The results of implementing CQRS show a fourfold increase in the number of classes and a 50\% increase in the number of lines of code. However, this increase is justified as it improves modularity, transparency, and manageability during development, ultimately facilitating system maintenance and significantly enhancing overall system productivity. It is worth noting that the overall cyclomatic complexity of the system remains almost unchanged.Insummary, the article examines the assessment of migrating a project from DDD architecture to CQRS and Event Sourcing, combining theoretical findings with practical experimentation. It provides valuable insights into the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges of implementing CQRS architecture in complex information systems.},

In order to do this, we assessed these metrics as predictors of fault-prone classes. This study is complementary to [Li\&Henry, 1993] where the same suite of metrics had been used to assess frequencies of maintenance changes to classes. To perform our validation accurately, we collected data on the development of eight medium-sized information management systems based on identical requirements. All eight projects were developed using a sequential life cycle model, a well-known OO analysis/design method and the C++ programming language. Based on experimental results, the advantages and drawbacks of these OO metrics are discussed. Several of Chidamber\&Kemerer’s OO metrics appear to be useful to predict class fault-proneness during the early phases of the life-cycle. We also showed that they are, on our data set, better predictors than “traditional” code metrics, which can only be collected at a later phase of the software development processes.},

This paper discusses the issues that lie in data management in distributed e-commerce systems and specifically emphasizes the synchronization of user interactions among multiple platforms such as customer interfaces and administrative portals. We examine three leading data handling algorithms: Event Sourcing, Change Data Capture (CDC), and Distributed Transactions, and explore their efficacy in maintaining data consistency, scalability, and fault tolerance. In a comparative analysis, we identify the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and offer insights into their viability in high- traffic e- commerce scenarios. Our results indicate that an event- driven architecture, together with the proper data handling algorithm, can drastically improve realtime synchronization performance, ultimately resulting in better user experience and operational effectiveness. This study adds to the existing body of knowledge on optimizing data management mechanisms in e- commerce systems, laying the groundwork for future innovation in real-time data processing.},
