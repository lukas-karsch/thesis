\section{Motivation (TODO)}

\section{Research questions}

This thesis provides a quantitative and qualitative comparison between Event Sourcing and traditional CRUD architectures. The primary research question is: \textbf{"How does an Event Sourcing architecture compare to CRUD systems with an independent audit log regarding performance, scalability, flexibility and traceability?"}

To provide a comprehensive answer, the following three sub-research questions (RS) are addressed:

\begin{enumerate}[label={RS \arabic*}]
    \item \textbf{Performance and Scalability:} How do \acrshort{crud} and \acrshort{es}-\acrshort{cqrs} implementations perform under increasing load, and what are the resulting implications for system scalability and resource efficiency? \label{rs-performance-scalability}
    \item \textbf{Architectural Complexity and Flexibility:} What are the fundamental structural differences between the two approaches, and how do these impact the long-term flexibility and evolution of the codebase? \label{rs-architecture}
    \item \textbf{Historical Traceability:} To what extent can \acrshort{crud} and \acrshort{es}-\acrshort{cqrs} systems accurately and efficiently reconstruct historical states to satisfy business intent and compliance requirements? \label{rs-traceability}
\end{enumerate}

The individual findings from these research questions are combined in the conclusion to provide a holistic answer to the primary research question.

\section{Goals and non goals (TODO)}
\label{sec:goals}

This section describes the goals and non-goals of the thesis.

Goals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create two implementations adhering to an identical interface
    \item Provide quantitative measurements of performance, architectural flexibility and traceability
    \item Implement both applications "the best they can be": according to principles and best practices for both architectures
    \item Use out-of-the box configurations to provide the performance comparisons
\end{itemize}

Non-goals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Perfectly implement DDD semantics
    \item Tune applications to get the best performance
    \item Implement mechanics to support schema evolution
    \item Implement full-grade application using security best practices, etc -> custom RequestContext with own "authorization" methods
\end{itemize}
